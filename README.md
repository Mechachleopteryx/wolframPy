# wolframPy - an implementation rule-based hypergraphs #

## Introduction ##

This repository is a toy implementation of some relations mapped into hypergraphs presented by Stephen Wolfram, 
when introducing the audience to the Wolfram Physics Project.

I do not take any credit in the work done by the man himself, this is just some of his work translated into 
Python using NetworkX. If you are curious to find out the theory behind all of this, do visit:
